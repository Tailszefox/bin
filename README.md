In this repository, you'll find a bunch of scripts I've written that I use to make my life easier. Most of them are written in Bash.

There are some I use daily, and some I only used a few times. Some are pretty complex, while some others were written in a few minutes. They all work on my machine, but there's no guarantee they'll work on yours, as they were not written to be portable or compatible with other systems.

If you're wondering what a script does, there's a comment at the top of each one explaining its intended purpose.
